## 🛠️ How It Works

- Tasks are stored as objects with `title`, `status`, and optional `tag`.
- Each task is displayed with a checkbox, tag label, and delete button.
- Data is synced to `localStorage` for persistence across sessions.
- Scroll-based visibility toggle for the "Back to Top" button using `scrollTop`.
- Debounce and throttle techniques enhance input and scroll performance.
